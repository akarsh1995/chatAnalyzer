16/02/19, 20:46 -  Bob: True. I guess there's still a long way to go before chatbots can truly replace human interaction.
16/02/19, 20:46 -  Alice: Definitely. But who knows, with advancements in AI, they might become even better in the future.
16/02/19, 20:46 -  Bob: That's true. Technology is constantly evolving, and it's exciting to see what the future holds.
